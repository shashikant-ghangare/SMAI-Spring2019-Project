## Main goals of the project

 - Implementing kernel trick(s) to make SVM work for non-linear cases. 
 
## Problem Definition
 
 - Support vectors in their raw form work only on linearly seprable data. But, what if the data isn't linearly seprable. To solve this problem, enter **Kernels**(kernel tricks).   
 - We will first implement a binary SVM from scratch using Python and convex optimization library. This will be our baseline.   
 - Then, we will implement one or more kernel tricks(s) to make SVM work for non-linearly seprable dataset.
 - Further extensions is to implement SVM for clustering and multi-class problems.
