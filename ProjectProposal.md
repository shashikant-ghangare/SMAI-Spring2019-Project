## Team Members 
  
    1. 2018801010 - Karnati Venkata Kartheek 
    2. 2018900061 - Shashikant Ghangare

## Main goals of the project

 - Implementing kernel trick(s) to make SVM work for non-linear cases. 
 
## Problem Definition

 - Support vectors in their raw form work only on linearly seprable data. But, what if the data isn't linearly seprable. To solve this problem, enter **Kernels**(kernel tricks). The problem definition is to implemeent SVM and kernel tricks to make SVM work for non-linear cases.
 
## Results of the project
 
 - Implementing binary SVM from scratch.   
 - Implementing one or more kernel tricks to make SVM work for non-linear cases. 
 - Implementing extensions to multiclass problems.
 
## Task allocation to each member

- We have not decided this yet.

## Project Milestones with timeline(expected)
- Implementing binary SVM from scratch.(by 5th April)
- Implementing kernel trick(s) to make SVM work for non-linear cases.(by 10th April)
- Implementing extensions to multiclass problems.(by 30th April)
